== Goals ==
releable p2p virtual private network with zero configuration


== Security goal ==
protocol:
    - no signature (is not possible block protocol by data pattern, port number)
    - fully encrypted (absolutelly no data (except length) can be extracted without knowledge of the key)
    - packet reinjection should not cause any problem for peers

outsider (single user)
    - can't modify network behavious
    - can't cause DOS attack
    - can't detect presense of the network on particular peer
outsider (watcher)
    - can't modify network behavious
    - can't cause DOS attack
    - can detect (with some probability) presense of the network by watching network traffic between peers
outsider (injector)
    - can't modify network behavious
    - can't cause DOS attack
    - can detect (with some probability) presense of the network by watching network traffic between peers
    - can't scan network by using intercepted data

insider
    - can't spoof other traffic
    - can't see other peer private traffic


== Configuration ==
--authority <path> path to authority public key
--public-key <path> path to public key
--private-key <path> path to private key

--interface <name> name of the interface for network connection. Default: all except 'lo'
  --weight
  --priority
--remote <address> static remove address. one should be specified for bootstrap

== Setup ==
multexconfig --create --authority-key <path> --key0 <path> --peer <ipv4>:<port>:<signature>


== Internals ==
Keys
 - Authority key (private + public). Private key should be keep in secret place. Peers do not need it. Public key should be abailable to all peers
 - Peer key (private + public). Present on particular peer. should be signed by Authority private key.
 - key0. (secret) derivered using Authority public key. Used to establish peer communication
 - key1 (secret) encrypt session between two peer.
 - key2 (secret) old key top encrypt session between two peer before new key negotiation is done.


network - peers with same Authority public key
peer - single instance of multex daemon
interface - one internet conection on peer (peer could be connected to multiple internet providers)
endpoint - IP address on interface. (provider could give more that one. E.G. ipv4 + ipv6)


== Proof of concent simplification ==
 - linux only
 - udp only
 - ipv4 only
